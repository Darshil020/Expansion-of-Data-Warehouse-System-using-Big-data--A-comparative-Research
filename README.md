# Expansion-of-Data-Warehouse-System-using-Big-data--A-comparative-Research
To propose best solution, the comparison study is carried out between data warehouse system expansion without Hadoop and data warehouse system expansion with Hadoop(80%) using complex total cost of ownership(TCO) and return on investment(ROI) for 6 years using World Wide Technology Data Warehouse Cost Saving Calculator. Various parameter have been taken into consideration and discussed in details for the comparison of two.  The new model architecture of the expanded data warehouse systems has been created to find out total hardware requirements and total cost of ownership for the 3 years. A comparative study has been carried out to compare cloud based big data implementation and premises based big data implementation using Microsoft Azure TCO calculator.   Various Hadoop contributors have been compared to choose best player using comparision of different parameter like File system, License Cost, Long term goal, consistency in Market, Partnership of Cloudera and Hortonworks with Teradata, etc.  After that conclusion/Executive summary have been derived to conclude which is the best system to implement and reasons for it.
